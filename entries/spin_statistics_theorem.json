  "explanation": "The spin–statistics theorem connects intrinsic spin with exchange symmetry of identical particles. Integer-spin particles have symmetric many-particle states under exchange, while half-integer-spin particles have antisymmetric states. This symmetry fixes the allowed single-level occupancies and implies Bose–Einstein statistics for integer spin and Fermi–Dirac statistics (with Pauli exclusion) for half-integer spin. In relativistic quantum field theory the exchange sign follows from Lorentz covariance, locality (microcausality), and positivity of energy.",
