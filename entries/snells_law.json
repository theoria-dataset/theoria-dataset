  "explanation": "Snell's law describes the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction when light passes from one medium to another with different optical properties. The law states that the product of refractive index and sine of angle remains constant across the interface. This fundamental principle governs the behavior of light in lenses, prisms, optical fibers, and explains phenomena like total internal reflection and mirages.",
