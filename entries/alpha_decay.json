  "explanation": "Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay where an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium-4 nucleus) consisting of two protons and two neutrons. This process occurs in heavy nuclei to reduce their mass and achieve greater stability through quantum tunneling through the Coulomb barrier. The decay energy Q-value determines the kinetic energies of the products and governs the decay probability.",
