  "explanation": "The third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero. This law provides an absolute reference point for entropy calculations and explains why absolute zero is unattainable. It has profound implications for low-temperature physics and quantum statistical mechanics.",
