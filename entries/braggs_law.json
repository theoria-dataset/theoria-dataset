  "explanation": "Bragg's law describes the conditions for constructive interference of X-rays diffracted by crystal lattice planes. When X-rays with wavelength λ are incident on parallel crystal planes separated by distance d, constructive interference occurs at specific angles θ where the path difference between rays equals an integer multiple of the wavelength. This fundamental law enables X-ray crystallography, allowing determination of crystal structures and atomic arrangements in materials.",
