  "explanation": "Bernoulli's equation is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics expressing conservation of mechanical energy along a streamline in steady, inviscid, incompressible flow. The equation states that the sum of pressure energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy per unit volume remains constant along a streamline. Derived from Newton's second law applied to fluid motion (Euler's equation), it provides the theoretical foundation for understanding pressure-velocity relationships in fluid flow and is essential for applications ranging from aircraft design to pipeline flow analysis.",
