  "explanation": "Bernoulli's equation asserts that along a streamline in steady, incompressible, inviscid flow the sum of static pressure, kinetic head and gravitational head remains constant. It translates fluid-energy conservation into a simple algebraic relation, connecting pressure differences with velocity changes. The equation governs Venturi meters, airfoil lift estimation and cardiovascular diagnostics, providing quick estimates of flow speed and pressure drop.",
