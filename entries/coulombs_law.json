  "explanation": "Coulomb's law describes the electrostatic force between two point charges, stating that the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of their separation distance. The force acts along the line connecting the charges, being repulsive for like charges and attractive for opposite charges. This fundamental law underlies all electrostatic phenomena and forms the basis for understanding electric fields and potentials.",
