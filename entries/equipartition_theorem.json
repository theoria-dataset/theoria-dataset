  "explanation": "The equipartition theorem states that each quadratic term in the Hamiltonian contributes (1/2)k_B*T to the average energy in thermal equilibrium. This fundamental principle of classical statistical mechanics explains heat capacities, connects microscopic motion to temperature, and provides the classical limit of quantum systems. It fails at low temperatures where quantum effects become important.",
