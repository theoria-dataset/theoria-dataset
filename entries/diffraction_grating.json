  "explanation": "A diffraction grating consists of many parallel slits or lines that diffract light, creating interference patterns with sharp, bright maxima at specific angles. The grating equation determines these angles based on the wavelength and grating spacing, making gratings powerful tools for spectroscopy. They provide high resolution separation of different wavelengths and are fundamental components in spectrometers, monochromators, and optical instruments.",
