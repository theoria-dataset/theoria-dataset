  "explanation": "The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the radiant energy flux emitted by an ideal black body as the fourth power of its absolute temperature, `j^* = sigma*T^4`. By linking thermodynamic temperature to measurable luminosity, the law is fundamental to stellar astrophysics, climate modelling and furnace engineering. It enables surface temperatures to be inferred from radiative output and sets theoretical efficiency limits for thermal devices.",
