  "explanation": "The first law states that for any closed system the change in internal energy `Delta U` equals heat supplied `Q` minus work done `W`. It enforces macroscopic energy conservation without specifying microscopic details, underpinning calorimetry, engine-cycle analysis and phase-transition studies. Engineers apply it to compute energy balances, determine heating requirements and set upper limits on process efficiency.",
