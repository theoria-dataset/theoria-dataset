  "explanation": "The thin lens equation relates the focal length of a lens to the object and image distances, forming the foundation of geometric optics. It describes how lenses form images by refraction, enabling the design of optical instruments from eyeglasses to telescopes. The equation applies to both converging and diverging lenses, with sign conventions determining whether images are real or virtual, upright or inverted.",
