  "explanation": "The Schrödinger equation gives the time evolution of the quantum state of a nonrelativistic particle. In its time-dependent form it is a linear first-order equation in time relating the complex wavefunction `psi(bbr,t)` to the Hamiltonian operator built from kinetic and potential energy. For potentials `V(bbr,t)` it determines how probability amplitudes spread, interfere and tunnel, while total probability is conserved. For time-independent potentials `V(bbr)` one can separate variables to obtain an eigenvalue problem for the spatial part `phi(bbr)`, whose discrete eigenvalues `E` describe stationary states and explain phenomena such as the quantized spectra of atoms.",
