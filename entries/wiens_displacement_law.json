  "explanation": "Wien's displacement law describes the relationship between the temperature of a blackbody and the wavelength at which it emits the maximum intensity of electromagnetic radiation. As temperature increases, the peak wavelength shifts toward shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), explaining why hot objects glow red, then white, then blue. This law is crucial for temperature measurements of stars, thermal imaging, and understanding blackbody radiation.",
