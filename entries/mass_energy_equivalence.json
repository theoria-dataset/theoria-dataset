  "explanation": "Einstein's relation `E = m*c^2` states that the rest energy of a body equals its invariant mass times the square of the speed of light. The formula unifies mass and energy, showing that mass can be converted to other energy forms and vice-versa. It underlies nuclear fission, fusion, particle–antiparticle creation and stellar power generation. Physicists use it whenever reaction thresholds, binding energies or annihilation yields must be balanced.",
