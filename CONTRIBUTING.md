# Contributing to TheorIA Dataset

Welcome to TheorIA dataset! This dataset provides a high-quality collection of theoretical physics equations, derivations, and explanations in a structured format. We encourage contributions from researchers, educators, and enthusiasts in the field of theoretical physics.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/theoria-dataset.git
   cd theoria-dataset
   ```

## Development Environment

For detailed setup instructions, testing procedures, and script documentation, see **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

Quick testing commands:
```bash
# Test a specific entry
make test-entry FILE=your_entry_name

# Test all entries  
make test
```

## Entry Guidelines

### Creating a New Entry

1. **Create a JSON file** in the `entries/` directory
2. **Follow the naming convention**: Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., `newtons_laws_of_motion.json`)
3. **Ensure the `result_id` matches the filename** (without .json extension)
4. **Validate your entry** against the schema using the testing commands above

### Entry Requirements

Each entry should be a self-contained, relevant physics result. The structure and requirements are defined in `schemas/entry.schema.json`. The auto-generated section below provides detailed field requirements.

### Testing Your Contributions

Before submitting:
1. **Run tests locally** using the Docker commands above
2. **Ensure all validation passes** - CI will automatically check this
3. **Test your specific entry**: `make test-entry FILE=your_entry_name`

## Submission Process

1. **Create a branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-quantum-harmonic-oscillator
   ```

2. **Add your entry** and test it thoroughly

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add entries/your_entry.json
   git commit -m "Add quantum harmonic oscillator entry"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-quantum-harmonic-oscillator
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** on GitHub

### Review Process

- CI will automatically validate your JSON against the schema
- Maintainers will review the physics content and derivations
- We may request changes or improvements
- Once approved, your contribution will be merged

## Automatic Jupyter Notebooks

Every entry automatically gets a corresponding Jupyter notebook generated for interactive exploration:

- **Location**: `notebooks/{result_id}_verification.ipynb`
- **Content**: Complete programmatic verification code with exact library versions
- **Google Colab Integration**: Each entry page includes an 'Open in Colab' badge
- **Automatic Generation**: Notebooks are regenerated automatically via GitHub Actions

When you contribute an entry, the system will automatically:
1. Generate a Jupyter notebook from your `programmatic_verification` code
2. Include proper library installation commands with exact versions
3. Add links back to the original entry for context
4. Make it available via Google Colab for interactive exploration

No manual action is needed - notebooks are maintained automatically!

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission issues**: Ensure Docker has proper permissions on Linux/macOS
- **Build failures**: Try `docker-compose build --no-cache` to rebuild from scratch
- **File changes**: Your local files are mounted into the container, so changes are immediately reflected

## Version Control & Collaboration

- We use Git and GitHub for versioning
- Submit pull requests for new entries or changes
- Ensure your JSON files validate against the schema (CI will check this automatically)
- Files are mounted into containers, so local changes are immediately reflected

## Example

See `entries/special_relativity_transformations.json` for a complete, compliant example.

## Dataset Entry Structure

Each entry should be a self-contained relevant physics result in JSON format.
All entries must be valid according to the schema in `schemas/entry.schema.json`.

- **`result_id`:**
  - Unique identifier that must exactly match the filename (without .json extension). Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores only. Choose descriptive names that clearly identify the physics concept.
  - Example:
    `lagrangian_mechanics`

- **`result_name`:**
  - Brief title to identify the entry. Keep concise (max 100 characters) and descriptive. Should clearly identify the physics concept.

- **`result_equations`:**
  - List of equations in AsciiMath format. Provide each equation with a unique ID (e.g., 'eq1', 'eq2'). Use AsciiMath format for all equations.
  - Example:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "eq1",
        "equation": "t' = gamma*(t - (v/c^2)*x)"
      }
    ]
    ```

- **`explanation`:**
  - Provide a brief (2â€“5 sentences, max 100 words) conceptual summary of the theoretical result or equation. Assume the reader has a graduate-level understanding of physics. Use clear and concise language to explain the significance, usage, and context of the theoretical result. Content should include: Definition or main concept, Why it matters in physics, How it's used or where it appears. Avoid derivation steps (covered in the derivation section), dense notation or inline math, empty generalities (e.g., "This is important in physics"), or overly technical jargon. If, exceptionally, there are math symbols or equations included, they must be enclosed in backticks (``) and written in AsciiMath format.
  - Example:
    `Lorentz transformations describe how space and time coordinates change between inertial frames moving relative to each other, ensuring the invariance of the speed of light and the spacetime interval. They are foundational to special relativity and crucial for understanding time dilation and length contraction.`

- **`definitions`:**
  - Define every symbol used in the result_equations to ensure the entry is self-contained by defining all symbols. Each definition should include a symbol field, with the symbol represented in AsciiMath format and a definition field. If there are math symbols or equations included in the definition, they must be enclosed in backticks (``) and written in AsciiMath format.
  - Example:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "symbol": "c",
        "definition": "Speed of light in vacuum."
      }
    ]
    ```

- **`assumptions`:**
  - Assumptions that lead to the result equations, which usually are either first principles, results from another entry specified in 'dependencies' or empirical results. List all assumptions required for the derivation. Use sequential IDs like 'assumption1', 'assumption2'. If there are math symbols or equations included, they must be enclosed in backticks (``) and written in AsciiMath format.

- **`derivation`:**
  - Provide a formal derivation of the result, including all steps, equations in AsciiMath format, and descriptions. Derivation should start from either first principles (listed in the field 'assumptions') or from other results derived in another entry, which should be specified in the 'dependencies' field. Each step should contain the `step` (an integer, in sequential order), `description` (textual rationale), and `equation` (AsciiMath format) fields. Include all steps for complete derivation. Use very explicit detail level for easy following.
  - Example:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "step": 1,
        "description": "Apply general linear transformation between reference frames.",
        "equation": "x' = A*x + B*t; t' = D*x + E*t"
      },
      {
        "step": 2,
        "description": "For an object at rest in the moving frame, x'=0 always.",
        "equation": "0 = A*v*t + B*t"
      }
    ]
    ```

- **`programmatic_verification`:**
  - Code that verifies the derivation correctness. Use minimal dependencies (pure Python or sympy). Should follow the steps of the derivation, explicitly in the comments. Include assert statements to verify correctness.

- **`domain`:**
  - ArXiv category identifier (e.g., 'gr-qc', 'hep-th') from https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy. Use official arXiv taxonomy identifiers.

- **`theory_status`:**
  - Current scientific status of the theory. current: Modern theories widely accepted by scientific community. historical: Important for development but superseded by better theories. approximation: Valid simplifications of more general theories. limiting_case: Special cases with restricted applicability. superseded: Completely replaced by more accurate theories.

- `validity_regime`:
  - Physical conditions where theory applies and limitations. Use for theories with specific applicability ranges. Include both conditions where valid and limitations.

- `superseded_by`:
  - Theories that supersede or generalize this result. Use exact result_id values (without .json extension). Must reference existing entries in the dataset.

- `approximation_of`:
  - The more general theory this approximates. Use exact result_id value (without .json extension).

- `historical_context`:
  - Educational context about theory's development. Provide importance, development period, and key insights.

- **`references`:**
  - Academic citations (1-3 references in APA style). Use APA format: Author(s). (Year). Title. Publisher/Journal, volume(issue), pages. DOI/URL.
  - Example:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "R1",
        "citation": "Einstein, A. (1905). 'On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies.' *Annalen der Physik*, 17, 891\u2013921."
      }
    ]
    ```

- `dependencies`:
  - Other entries this result relies on. Use exact result_id values (without .json extension). Only include direct dependencies.

- **`review_status`:**
  - Review status of the entry. Use 'draft' for initial submissions. Use 'reviewed' for entries approved for main dataset.

## Testing

To ensure the quality and correctness of entries, run these commands:

```bash
make test
