        "## Description\n",
        "In vacuum, Maxwell's equations imply that disturbances of the electromagnetic field propagate as waves whose speed is fixed by the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of free space. Combining the curl equations for E and B leads to a wave equation with propagation speed v = 1/sqrt(epsilon_0*mu_0). Identifying this speed with the experimentally measured speed of light shows that light is an electromagnetic wave and fixes the universal constant c from purely electromagnetic measurements.\n",
