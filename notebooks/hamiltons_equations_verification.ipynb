        "Hamilton's equations are a set of first-order differential equations governing the evolution of generalized coordinates (`q_i`) and conjugate momenta (`p_i`). They provide a symmetric phase-space formulation equivalent to the Euler-Lagrange equation, often simplifying analysis of conserved quantities and facilitating the transition to quantum mechanics.\n",
