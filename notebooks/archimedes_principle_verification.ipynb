        "Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force exerted on an object immersed in a fluid equals the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This principle arises from the hydrostatic pressure distribution in the fluid and explains phenomena such as floating, sinking, and apparent weight reduction in fluids. It underpins fluid statics and has practical applications in ship design, density measurements, and natural buoyancy.\n",
