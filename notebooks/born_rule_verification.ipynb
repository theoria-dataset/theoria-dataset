        "The Born rule specifies how a quantum state yields measurable probabilities for any well-defined measurement. Given a state and a measurement description, it assigns a normalized probability to each possible outcome in a way consistent with observed frequencies under repeated trials. This rule provides the operational meaning of the quantum state and sets the predictive, testable character of quantum theory across experiments and applications.\n",
