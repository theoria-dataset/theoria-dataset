        "## Description\n",
        "The Born rule connects the quantum state to experimental statistics: it assigns probabilities to measurement outcomes from the state vector or density operator. In position space it yields ρ(x,t)=|ψ(x,t)|², and in the general measurement framework it gives P(i)=Tr(ρ E_i) for POVM elements E_i. It is the standard link between theory and measurement across nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics.\n",
