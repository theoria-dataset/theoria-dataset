        "The Born rule specifies how a quantum state yields measurable probabilities for any well-defined measurement. Given a state and a measurement description, it assigns a normalized probability to each possible outcome in a way consistent with observed frequencies under repeated trials. This rule is a foundational postulate: it provides the operational meaning of the quantum state and underpins the predictive, testable character of quantum theory across experiments and applications.\n",
