        "## Description\n",
        "The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that for any pair of non-commuting observables their statistical spreads (standard deviations) in a given quantum state cannot both be made arbitrarily small. The general Robertson relation ties the product Delta A * Delta B to the expectation value of their commutator, while the canonical position–momentum case gives Delta x * Delta p_x >= hbar/2. This expresses a structural limitation imposed by the quantum operator algebra rather than by experimental imperfections.\n",
