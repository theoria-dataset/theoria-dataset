        "Angular momentum is conserved when no external torque acts on a system. This fundamental conservation law explains phenomena from planetary motion to figure skating spins. Angular momentum equals the cross product of position and momentum vectors, or the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity for rigid bodies.\n",
