        "Faraday's law describes how a changing magnetic flux through a closed loop induces an electromotive force (EMF) in that loop. The induced EMF is proportional to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux, which explains electromagnetic induction phenomena including electric generators, transformers, and inductors.\n",
