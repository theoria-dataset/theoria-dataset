        "The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution describes the probability distribution of particle speeds in a classical ideal gas at thermal equilibrium. It shows that most particles have intermediate speeds, with exponentially fewer particles at very high speeds. This distribution is fundamental to kinetic theory and statistical mechanics.\n",
