        "Planck's quantum hypothesis revolutionized physics by proposing that electromagnetic energy is emitted and absorbed in discrete packets called quanta, with energy proportional to frequency. This fundamental relation ended the ultraviolet catastrophe of classical physics and birthed quantum mechanics. It explains the photoelectric effect, atomic spectra, and provides the foundation for all quantum phenomena.\n",
